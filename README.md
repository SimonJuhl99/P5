Clone this into your NS-3 root directory, probably placed inside other NS-3 directory, in a path similar to ```ns3/ns-allinone-3.36.1/ns-3.36.1/```  
Do this by entering that directory in your *terminal* and write ```git clone https://github.com/SimonJuhl99/P5.git```  
This will give you a new directory like ```ns-3.36.1/P5``` where this Git is inside the *P5* directory.
