## Writing to Terminal
### Logging
To do so in NS-3, usually NS-3's *logging* system is used.  

To see an easy example of this, check the example-code in *scratch/scratch-simulator.cc*  
All this file does, is start up the logging "system" and write out "*Scratch Simulator*"


### Normal "Prints"
Should still be available to use... but NS-3 won't be able to "see" them.  

Use ```std::cout``` instead of ```print()``` though. It's more "forgiving".  

To make it easier, you could ad ```using namespace std;``` in the top of your script, so you can just write ```cout```instead. Doing this also makes it easier to work with *Strings* if needed, as they're also a part of the *std* library, and not natively supported in *C++*.
