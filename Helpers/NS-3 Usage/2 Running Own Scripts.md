## Setup for running own scripts
NS-3 only want to run self-made scripts from it's *scratch* directory.  

So...  
To be able to run our scripts from our own directory, insert the all the placeholder/parsing files from the *P5/Helpers/Using NS-3/Script Parsers* directory into NS-3's *scratch* directory.  

Change the include path in all of them, to your personal path. *(Search/Replace on multiple files is probably preferable)*
