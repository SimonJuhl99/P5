# Analysis Data

## Pcap Files
##### *example/tutorial/second.cc*
This has a small example of Pcap capture for *Point-to-point* connections.

Just by adding:
```C
pointToPoint.EnablePcapAll ("second");
csma.EnablePcap ("second", csmaDevices.Get (1), true);
```
This starts tracing and creation of *Pcap* files in each *Point-to-point* node, and exports the trace-data, each separate connection in their own file, named "second" followed by the two nodes in the connection.  
Example *second-0-1.pcap* as the file with the connection between node 0 and 1.

## Tracing
For tracing some random specific thing... like... when a specific node receives a specific packet... or... all packets... or a specific packet on any node.... **maybe**... I'm confused... **Simon knows everything**

Is a general example/introduction to tracing
